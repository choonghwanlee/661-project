'''
Weakly Supervised Learning:
    -Combines several methods:
        - using fine-tuned SAM + post-processing to generate pseudo-labels
    - uses pseudo-labels as real labels for fine-tuning
'''


## step 1: load unlabelled data into numpy arrays


## step 2: run fine-tuned SAM on batch of images


## step 3: post-processing of masks generated 


## step 4: fine-tuned with pseudo-masks
